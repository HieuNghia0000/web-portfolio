    "about": "My name is **Phan Hieu Nghia**. I am a full-stack developer with a strong focus on front-end development using ReactJS and TypeScript, and back-end development with Spring Boot and Java.\n\n\nI am passionate about building scalable, responsive, and maintainable web applications that deliver great user experiences and solid performance under the hood. My love for both design and logic helps me bridge the gap between the user interface and server-side functionality. I constantly seek to improve my skills by learning new technologies, following best practices, and working on challenging projects. Outside of coding, I enjoy exploring UI/UX principles, solving real-world problems through software, and collaborating with others to bring ideas to life. My goal is to become a well-rounded software engineer who creates impactful and high-quality digital solutions.",
